# React + Vite

# Tic tac toe game made in React.  
I made use of these react concepts and hooks, useState, useEffect, Functions, Conditions.

# This web app was in 2 phases
Now I designed the logic for this tic-tac-toe myself, so originally I thought to go with the approach of using key/value pairs in an object with each key representing a part of the tic-tac-toe grid. This initially worked perfectly, but I felt it would be better to optimize it by using arrays instead.

Overall undergoing project open my eyes to world of react, and made me a better developer.
